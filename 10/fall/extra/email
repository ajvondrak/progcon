performers again solved all four problems (I'll have to work on
including more difficult problems)...

2. Alex Gutierrez and
   Stephen Crane (solved 4 problems, 2 in C++ and 2 in Java)

Several of the participants will represent Cal Poly Pomona at the ACM
Southern California Regional Programming Contest on Saturday,
November 13 at Riverside Community College.
