This contest was funny.  In an effort to jazz up the prizes, it was our idea to
award money to the shortest & the fastest solutions to each problem.  We
thought it might distribute the rewards across more than just the usual
finishers (at this point, Kevan, Stephen, and I were kind of locking up the top
3 slots), and also foster more fun vectors along which to compete.

What *actually* happened is that Stephen got more prize money, haha.
(Actually, I don't remember if we had cash associated with the challenges.)
Brian DeWolf and I also snagged a few points.

Oh, and "flush" caused me some grief with programming errors.  First, because I
had Python's list append/pop flipped around, and it wasn't actually working
like a queue as I thought it was.  Second, during debugging, I spent way too
long being bewildered by the output of some print statements I'd inserted.
Turns out it was an issue with the variable names I was using in Python's list
comprehensions, because their scope was broader than I anticipated:

  >>> [n for n in range(10)]
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  >>> n
  9

I really can't say anymore if that was the error solved by my final submission.
My email at the time of my successful submission literally read

> I'm so confused.  :(
>
> --Alex Vondrak

but I got a reply that the program produced correct output.  Ha!
