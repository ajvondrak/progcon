Didn't do as well at this contest.  Kind of a bummer after getting first place
the quarter before.  I was just racking up dumb mistakes:

* Didn't think to just use `map(chr, range(32, 127))` for the ASCII values in huffman_code, so missed some characters for the first submission.

* Had some dumb whitespace issues with the first time_coordinator submission.

* Spent an eternity and a bunch of (pointless/frustrated) submissions to ultimately fail on vote_verifier until I realized my dumb mistake shortly after the contest had closed.  I was losing leading 0s by converting incoming strings into integers.  D'oh.

Oh yeah, now that I look at the rankings, Diana got her vote_verifier
submission in right at 6 PM, thus thoroughly putting me to shame, haha.  That's
the only time I recall someone being right on the deadline's dot.

Spent some time after the contest tidying up the code to make it shorter.  Not
really "golfing" in the extremest sense, but whatever.
