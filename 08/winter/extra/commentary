Turns out I was starting to get the hang of these contests!  No penalty time or
anything.

But I was too stupid to figure out the relation for turning_radius, despite it
being The Easy Problem.  I knew it'd be simple, and I was racing against the
clock to figure out the trig.

It was humorous, though.  Lance was sitting next to me, and I knew he'd solved
the problem long ago.  6 PM struck, so I said "fuck it", turned to him, and
asked him what the damned equation was.  He told me, I plugged it in, and sent
my turning_radius.py.  I was so close to solving all 4 problems---even close to
hitting first place.  So, the (unsurprising) salt in the wound was that the
submission was correct, but at 6:03:40 pm.  Jovial swearing was had in the
computer lab.  I went all Steve Ballmer on a chair.  Good times.
