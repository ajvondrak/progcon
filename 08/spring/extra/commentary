Ah, this contest was special.  First (and almost only) time I won first place,
even against all the people who solved all four problems.  Some of my friends
will remember that I beat Jonathan Dautrich who, in our minds, was the reigning
champion of the time.  Stephen Crane of course dominated all subsequent
contests, haha.

This was also the origin of the famous quodigious!  For awhile after the
contest, it became a project for me & my friends to port quodigious to other
programming languages and try to beat each other with shorter & faster
solutions.
