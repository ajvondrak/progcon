This was a brutal contest for me.  I would've had three problems solved, but I
couldn't fix string_picker.  My head formulated the solution recursively, and I
was afraid I'd blow the stack on the acid input.  It didn't do that, but it did
take more than 2 CPU minutes on Dr. Rich's machine.  I think that's the only
programming contest solution I've ever had that timed out, so that's
interesting; not a very common failure mode.

Instead of moving on, I guess I spent a long time trying to convert it into a
dynamic programming version.  To this day, I still have problems thinking in
terms of DP, so that didn't go so well.  My second failed submission was
actually me just submitting the same solution as before "for fun", with my odd
experiments commented out.

It wasn't until some time after the contest that I saw the acid input that was
taking a long time was just a string of about a billion "a"s.  I memoized my
recursive function, and it completed in about a second and a half.  Fuck!
Lesson learned: if your recursive solution to a programming contest problem is
taking too long, it doesn't hurt to try memoizing it.

Aside from that, this contest was the first time I won the "lightning round" of
being the first to submit a correct solution to a problem.  This would later
become a trend for me.  No prizes or recognition for it, but it was interesting
to me.  :-)
