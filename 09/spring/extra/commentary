An uneventful contest.  There were very few participants.  Stephen did a
bang-up job, remotely solving all the problems while on the road.

I used a class again for "diceline".  I think this was clearly one I could've
done without, though.  Just wound up taking me too much time to write it.

"amazed" was simple because I was in a graph theory course at the time and we
were discussing breadth-first searches.  Not that BFSes were new to me, but it
helped having the topic in my mind, back before I realized how many problems
can be framed in terms of graph theory.  Still somehow took me the longest to
code, though.
