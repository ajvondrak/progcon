Wish I had the rankings for this contest.  It must've been a tough one, because
Stephen only solved 3 problems as well.  I wonder which ones?

The only other thing I really remember about this contest was how unusual it
was that I resorted to writing a class for "elevator".  I don't often need to
simulate state like that in programming contests.  Probably could've done
without, but I was having a hard time thinking about it without an Elevator
object to act upon.

"overload" also seems like one of the messier solutions I've written for Dr.
Rich's contests.  Maybe I was just out of it that day.  Or just spending a lot
of time on the problems.  Seems I didn't make any failed submissions, but still
only had 3 of them, so I was probably just taking a long time per problem.
Which is kind of borne out by how long the code was for "elevator" and
"overload".
