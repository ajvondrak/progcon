Programming Contest Submissions
=

I went to [Cal Poly Pomona](http://www.csupomona.edu/) from 2006 to 2012 as an undergrad, graduate, and lecturer in computer science.  Each quarter (more or less), the student Computer Science Society would host programming contests run by the club's long-time advisor, [Dr.  Rich](http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/).

This repo is a historical archive of my performance at all of those contests: the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I'm retroactively organizing and assembling as much data as I can about the contests, just because I think it'll be interesting to look at it all and share it with others.  I would say I "regrettably" don't have Git commit histories for each quarter's performance, but these contests consisted of 4 hours of diligent coding against the clock, so I wouldn't have had the time to commit every little thing anyway.  But those that do have separate Git histories, I'll probably just put in their own repos.
