Won the lightning round again.  Towards the end of my programming contest
"career", I guess I got good at identifying the easiest problems to attack.  If
only I could carry that speed through the remaining problems!

Tried to be too clever with cockeyed_boxes at first, but learned my lesson from
a few contests ago and preemptively memoized my recursive algorithm.  Turned
out fine.
