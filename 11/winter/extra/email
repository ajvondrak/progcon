Congratulations to everyone who participated in the Winter 2011 CSS Programming Contest. The contest problems, solutions and example inputs/outputs are available at

   http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/

The top three performers will be awarded prizes in the form of $100, $75 and $50 American Express gift cards. This quarter, the top two are familiar names from the winners' circles of past CSS Programming Contests.

   1. Stephen Crane (solved all 4 problems, 1 in Java and 3 in Python)
   2. Alex Vondrak (solved all 4 problems in Python)
   3. Keenan Breik (solved 2 problems in Java)

The turnout for the contest was strong and included several first-time participants. I was also impressed that a number of contestants solved a problem without submitting any incorrect solutions. Thanks also to alumnus Jonathan Dautrich for noticing the event and participating remotely. Jonathan is a multiple winner of past CSS Programming Contests and is currently a Ph.D. student at UC Riverside.

The complete rankings and record of all program submissions is attached.
