Congratulations to everyone who participated in the Spring 2011 CSS Programming Contest. The contest problems, solutions and example inputs/outputs are available at

  http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/

The top three (non-alumni) performers will be awarded prizes in the form of $100, $75 and $50 American Express gift cards..

  1. Stephen Crane (solved all 4 problems, 1 in Haskell and 3 in Python)
  2. Keenan Breik (solved 3 problems in Java)
  3. Paul Rizardo (solved 3 problems in Java)

This year, there was an impressive percentage of participants who solved multiple problems, and a nice variety of programming languages (with Java making somewhat of a resurgence). Thanks again to alumnus Jonathan Dautrich for noticing the event and participating remotely. Jonathan is a multiple winner of past CSS Programming Contests and is currently a Ph.D. student at UC Riverside. I want to especially thank and commend Stephen Crane, who is participating in his last CSS Programming Contest (unless he returns as an alumnus, in which case we might need a veterans' bracket). He has programmed in nine CSS Programming Contests, and has won the last seven of those while correctly solving 27 of 28 problems.

The complete rankings and record of all program submissions is attached.
