9 minutes to solve the first problem!

Unfortunately, the rest of the contest I was severely off my game.  After the
first hour of trying to solve ack_attack and being confused at it, Dr. Rich
sent an email that the sample output was wrong.  Spent another hour trying to
patch it, but still didn't get anywhere.  Maybe it would've gone better had I
been there in person.

Anyway, lost all my time to that.  Started at dancing_squares half-heartedly,
but I was so out of it that I didn't feel like writing code to transpose
matrices...yeah...
