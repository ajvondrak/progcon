Congratulations to everyone who participated in the Fall 2011 CSS
Programming Contest. The contest problems, solutions and example
inputs/outputs are available at

   http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/

The top three (non-alumni) performers will be awarded $150, $100, and
$50 prizes, respectively.

   0. Alex Gutierrez, Constantine Chen, Keenan Breik
                      (solved 3 problems, two in C++ and one in Java)
   1. William Thomas  (solved two problems in Java)
   2. Charles Frayne  (solved two problems in C++)
   3. Joshua Scoggins (solved two problems in C#)

This quarter, there was a record number of participants and program
submissions, and the top two prizes will go to first-time participants in
the CSS Programming Contest, William Thomas and Charles Frayne.
Congratulations also to the team of Alex Gutierrez, Constantine Chen and
Keenan Breik, who solved three problems (and declined prize money...
something about a conflict of interest and the treasurer awarding the
treasurer). They will be one of four teams representing Cal Poly Pomona at
the Southern California Region of the ACM International Collegiate
Programming Contest (ICPC) this Saturday at Riverside Community College.

It was good to see new faces among the medal winners, although recent
graduates Stephen Crane and Alex Vondrak (who had collectively won eight
of the last nine contests) participated, and both solved all four
problems... just to keep the bar set high.

The complete rankings and record of all program submissions is attached.
