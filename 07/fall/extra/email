Congratulations to everyone who participated in the Fall 2007 CSS 
Programming Contest. Special commendation to Jonathan Dautrich, who solved 
all four problems without a single incorrect submission. The contest 
problems, solutions and example inputs/outputs are available at

    http://www.csupomona.edu/~carich/programming_contests/

The performances were better than ever, which bodes well for our prospects 
next weekend at the ACM Regional Programming Contest, where we'll have 
four teams competing. The top performers this quarter...

    1. Jonathan Dautrich (solved 4 problems)
    2. Stephen Crane     (solved 3 problems using Python...
                          and hasn't yet taken CS 140!)
    3. Robert Donnelly & Victor Brode
                         (solved 2 problems, welcome ECE majors)
    4. Mark Kluegel      (solved 2 problems)
    5. Lance Simons      (solved 2 problems)

The complete rankings and record of all program submissions is attached.
I note that this contest saw the greatest variety of programming languages
to date... there were correct solutions submitted in C, C++, Java, Python,
Ruby and PHP.
