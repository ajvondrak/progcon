Third contest in, getting better.  I went from 0 problems solved, to 1 problem,
to 1 problem with time to spare (1.5 problems?).  At this rate, I figured I
would be solving entire problemsets within a year or two.

I got some penalty time on "gear_up" because Dr. Rich was running an old Python
version where the sort method didn't take a key parameter.
