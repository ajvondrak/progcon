I want to thank all of you for participating in the programming contest
and congratulate one and all. Special congratulations go to the top
performers:

    1. Lance Simons (welcome to Cal Poly Pomona!)
    2. Jonathan Dautrich
    3. Jeremy Nissen
    4. Mark Kluegel
    5. Kevin Smith

The top 5 all solved (the same) two problems. As I understand it, the
top three performers will receive a valuable prize (Bronco bucks?) from
the CSS club at an upcoming meeting. I also want to recognize Alex
Vondrak, who was the only contestant to correctly solve one of the
"harder" two problems. Let's do it again next quarter.

I have attached a PDF giving the detailed results and contest standings.
