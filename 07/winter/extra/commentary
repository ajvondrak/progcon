I spent the whole of this contest working on the "poker" problem.  Turns out I
was the only to have done so.

At this point, I was still using Windows and didn't understand the concept of
piping files into stdin.  My first submission broke on EOF.  My second
submission was funny, because I had forgotten to comment out the tests I jotted
in the file.  So, syntax error.  Woops.  The final submission still has an
extraneous prompt, but Dr. Rich went easy on me.

Years later, I would learn that these problems were very common among the
underclassmen at Cal Poly.  I had to teach students how to work a Unix prompt
in their Data Structures & Algorithms class when I adopted a similar system for
their projects.
