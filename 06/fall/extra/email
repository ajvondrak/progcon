I want to thank all of you for participating in the programming contest
and congratulate one and all. Special congratulations go to the top
performers from Cal Poly Pomona:

    1. Jonathan Dautrich
    2. Steven Myint
    3. Donald Benson
    4. Brian DeWolf

Despite the hit-and-miss mail queue delays, I was pleased with the
turnout and the difficulty of the problems. I think it bodes well for
our programming teams that will be attending the ACM Southern California
Regional Programming Contest at Riverside Community College this coming
Saturday.

I have attached a PDF giving the detailed results and contest standings.
